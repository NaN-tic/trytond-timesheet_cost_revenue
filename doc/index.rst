Timesheet Cost Revenue Module
#############################

It adds cost and revenue computations in timesheet works:

 * The revenue is computed from the time spent in the work and the list price (the list price can be computed from a product service).
 * The cost is computed from the time spent in each timesheet line and the cost of the employee that has done it.
